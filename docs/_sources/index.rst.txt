====================================
Welcome to openEPhys_DACQ repository
====================================

This is a system for automated experiments acquiring neural data using `OpenEhysGUI <https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI>`_. It combines online tracking from any number of cameras with a behavioural task program and peripherals for interacting with the subject. The package comes with an easy to use graphical interface.

The original purpose for this system was to collect neural data from rodents performing a navigational task in a large environment.

    - Any number of cameras
        + Built-in calibration to same reference frame
    - Multiple tracking methods
        + Motion
        + 1 LED (brightest spot)
        + 2 LED (different luminance)
* Reward devices
    - Pellet Feeder
        + Releases specified number of pellets on command

System overview and the user manual
===================================

In depth description of the system is in the :ref:`userManual_SystemOverview` section of the :ref:`userManual`

Installation
============

This document details every step required for setting up an Ubuntu PC for electrophysiological data collection using `OpenEhysGUI <https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI>`_, separate tracking system using Raspberry Pis and two different Rasperry Pi based reward modules. The instructions detail every single step, every line of code required to get things running. Therefore, it is definitely painfully long to work through for an advanced user, if not amusing at times. The reason for such detail is that anyone could set it up.

Occasionally the document includes instructions in double brackets, where the steps may not me necessary but were made by me during the setup process. E.g. *((Do this, in case otherwise something will not work later on))*.

All terminal commands written here should be run while in home directory, unless instructed to call on a specific file. This ensures a sensible folder structure is created.

The instructions can be worked through in the order they are presented in the below table to set up the system from ground up.
